# Fashion Ranking 


## Overview

The fashion trend can be analyzed in two ways
- From supervised data from e-commerce sites
- unsupervised data from catalogues and social media

Hence we have two ranking algorithms for these two cases

##  Unsupervised Fashion Ranking

We developed a graph based ranking algorithm to get a score for each fashion image

### Scope For Improvement

We could use quadruplet loss, which has soft positive and hard positive, the semantics of the class names can be used to identify soft positive and hard positive classes
